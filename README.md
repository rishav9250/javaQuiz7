What do we get in the JDK file?


JDK- For making java programs, we need some tools that are provided by JDK (Java Development Kit). JDK is the package that contains various tools, Compiler, Java Runtime Environment, etc.
JRE -  To execute the java program we need an environment. (Java Runtime Environment) JRE contains a library of Java classes +  JVM. What are JAVA Classes?  It contains some predefined methods that help Java programs to use that feature, build and execute. For example - there is a system class in java that contains the print-stream method, and with the help of this, we can print something on the console.
JVM - (Java Virtual Machine) JVM  is a part of JRE that executes the Java program at the end.  Actually, it is part of JRE, but it is software that converts bytecode into machine-executable code to execute on hardware.
